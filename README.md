# cdr-coded

Semi-abandoned:  This was originally originally going to serve as the basis for a C++ Lisp with some nice data structures. It never got far enough to actually evaluate code, but it does have some cool data structures that I will (or at least would) plunder the next time (whenever or whether that may be) I decide to write a project in C++.
